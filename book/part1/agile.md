# Agile methodologies

## Why choose a project management  methodology?

> Without a design approach, programmers resort to designing as we go, typing in
> code, trying what works, and making it up as we go along. When trying to
> collaborate to make software with others this can result in lots of wasted
> time, software that only the author understands, components built by
> colleagues that don’t work together, or code that the programmer thinks is
> nice but that doesn’t meet the user’s requirements.
