# Tasks & Kanban

When the project can be **divided into tasks**, it is convenient to manage the
workflow using the Kanban method.

:class: note
The term Kanban comes from Japanese and translates as “signal card”. Originally,
Kanban was used in Toyota’s production facilities, where it also influenced 
agile development in IT and other departments. The aim is to establish a 
constant, orderly workflow. Moreover, Kanban can be combined with other agile 
methods such as Scrum.

Kanban can be used to managing workflow from the individual up to organizational
level.
