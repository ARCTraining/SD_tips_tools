# Software Development Life Cycle

Most coding trainings/lessons just focus on developing coding writing skills.
However, this is just a step in the software development process.

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a cycle composed of seven steps:

* Ideation
* Requirements
* Design
* Development
* Testing
* Deployment
* Maintenance

## Ideation

First is necessary define a problem to solve: *What are we going to do?*

Two techniques are useful in the Ideation step:

* Brainstorming
* Research

```{admonition} Brainstorming
Brainstorming helps to explore your project concepts, generate new ideas, and 
reject bad ones.
```

```{admonition} Research
To create a relevant work it is necessary to know the environment in which it is
inserted. Research helps to validate ideas from brainstorming sessions
```

## Requirements

Define a project plan: *How are we going to do it?*

In this step it is necessary to gather software requirements from **everyone**
involved in the project.

```{warning}
Each person involved in the project may have a different need, so it is
necessary to check with each one what they need. 

For example, in an academic environment, the PI usually has a more global view
of the project, while other participants have a more specific view.
```

Some topics to help define requirements include:

* final goal
* project scope (how to reach the final goal)
* what is feasible (and how)
* what is priority
* what resources are available
* deadlines
* potential risks

### Software Requirement Specification

All information regarding the requirements must be organized in a file, the
*Software Requirement Specification*.

**Everyone** involved in the project should review this document.
If any requirement has a problem (is incomplete, unclear, ambiguous, etc.), it
must be identified and corrected.

```{tip}
Depending on the characteristics of the project, it may be useful to generate
some additional documents to help understand the requirements.

For example, if the project is related to data collection, a Data Flow Diagram
can be help to track all variables, their connections and clarify requirements.
```
