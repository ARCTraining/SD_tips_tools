# Software Development Life Cycle

Most coding trainings/lessons just focus on developing coding writing skills.
However, this is just a step in the software development process.

**Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)** is a cycle composed of seven steps:

* Ideation
* Requirements
* Design
* Development
* Testing
* Deployment
* Maintenance

## Ideation

First is necessary define a problem to solve: *What are we going to do?*

Two techniques are useful in the Ideation step:

* Brainstorming
* Research

```{admonition} Brainstorming
Brainstorming helps to explore your project concepts, generate new ideas, and 
reject bad ones.
```

```{admonition} Research
To create a relevant work it is necessary to know the environment in which it is
inserted. Research helps to validate ideas from brainstorming sessions
```
