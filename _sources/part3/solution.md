# Participants solution

Participants used github as a platform to collaboratively solve the proposed 
problem.

An empty GitHub repository was created by me  and the
participants were added as Collaborators.

The workflow was organized through GitHub by using:

- GitHub issues
- Pull requests (PR)
- PR Approvals

You can find the solution in the `rse_cdt_project2022` repository
[here](https://github.com/patricia-ternes/rse_cdt_project2022).
